# Sphinx Routes

## Features

- **Log in Troll:** Log in page with deceiving sign up options and pranks embedded into it.

- **Sign Up Page:** Functional sign up page with live validation and requirements for all input fields. 

- **Click The Button Page:** Near Impossible find the button game where the user needs to find and click the button four times before advancing.
